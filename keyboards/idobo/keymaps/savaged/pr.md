# Layout aimed at easy transition between Idobo and standard 60% keyboard

An adaption from the default Idobo layout aimed at making an easy transition between the ortholinear 75 layout and a standard 60% layout, one where the arrow keys are with WSDA and/or 'Vim HJKL'.

## Description

The changes are exclusively confined to altering the layout of keys. The only file changed is the `keymap.c` in `keyboards/idobo/keymaps/[my user name]/`
